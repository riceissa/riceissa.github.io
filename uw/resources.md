# Resources for the University of Washington

A collection of information about the University of Washington (and also
college in general).
Currently it’s [too easy to lose things on Quora](https://www.quora.com/How-do-people-find-posts-on-Quora-that-theyve-written-but-completely-forgotten-about), so I am posting here.
Please let me know if there are any other good resources or if there are mistakes here.
(You can leave a comment [here](http://riceissa.wordpress.com/uw/) or email me at the reverse of moc.liamg@assiecir.)

Note that even if you’re not logged in on Quora, adding <code>/?share=1</code> to the end of the URL allows you to view *all* answers, not just the first one.

Alex says, in part:

    > Make yourself **extremely** stalkable and Googleable (and clearly
    > mark that you're open to emails and random Facebook friend
    > requests from strangers). And also - archive up \*all\* the
    > interesting things you've gathered up and put them somewhere
    > that's \*ultra-accessible\*, so that they can easily find them.
    > Use the cloud as your storage space, and default most of your
    > Facebook status updates to public.

## UW Honors

-   For a comparison of UW Honors to top schools, see the Quora question
    “[How does the University of Washington honors program undergraduate student quality compare with that of top schools like MIT and Caltech?](https://www.quora.com/How-does-the-University-of-Washington-honors-program-undergraduate-student-quality-compare-with-that-of-top-schools-like-MIT-and-Caltech)”

- [What is the Honors program at the University of Washington like? Is it worth joining?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-Honors-program-at-the-University-of-Washington-like-Is-it-worth-joining)

- There are many examples of honors portfolios available [here](https://sites.google.com/a/uw.edu/the-honors-portfolio/portfolio-examples).
You may need a UW account to see some of them, though.

## Computer science and engineering (CSE)

## Atmospheric science

- [What is it like to study Atmospheric Science at the University of Washington?](https://www.quora.com/What-is-it-like-to-study-Atmospheric-Science-at-the-University-of-Washington)
In particular, Alex K. Chen says:

   > Personally, I think the ideal combination would be to major in CS at UW, take the grad-lvl courses (as well as the computational courses) in the Atmospheric Science department, and then do Atmospheric Science research at UW. That way you get an undergrad degree from one of UW's best undergrad programs, and research in a department where you can get more personal attention than almost any other department in the entire school.

- [What are some downsides to doing research in atmospheric science?](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-downsides-to-doing-research-in-atmospheric-science) (Alex K. Chen’s and Reena Joubert’s answers are especially good.)

The [article](http://www.wired.com/2009/12/15943/) Kite links to is intriguing.
