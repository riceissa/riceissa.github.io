things to talk about eventually:

- `\(p \leftrightarrow q\)` vs `\(p \equiv q\)`.
- bound variables in expressions like `\(\int_a^b f(x)\, dx\)` and `\(\sum_{i=0}^n f(i)\)` vs in ones like `\(\exists x P(x)\)`
- why different results for partial and total derivative? cf. Tao's analysis book
    
    Tao's example: take `\(f\)` defined by `\(f(x,y) = (x^2, y^2)\)`.
    Then `\(\displaystyle \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = (2x,0\)`, whereas `\(\displaystyle \frac{d}{dx}f(x,x) = (2x,2x)\)`.
